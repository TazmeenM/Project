I started making a program to help people track the books they've read! It's nowhere near completed, but I've made some amount of progress on it.

Note: The bread was supposed to be either a motivational character or a currency system, but I haven't gotten around to actually adding it yet.

Instructions:

1. Download this repository as a .zip file and extract it
2. Run the Batch file
3. Use the command prompt, since the Java window with the GUI doesn't actually do anything interesting yet

Note: If running the Batch file doesn't work, try running the Main.java file instead.
